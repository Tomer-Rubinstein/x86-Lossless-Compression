# x86 Project: Lossless Compression

Lossless data compression using the Huffman Coding algorithm.

Built for the DOS operating system using x86 Assembly.

## Build
Install DOSBox [here](http://data.cyber.org.il/assembly/dosbox.exe) (not tested on other emulators).

To use ``auto`` from the main directory, add ``utils`` to path:
```bash
cd x86-Lossless-Compression
set path=%path%;.\utils
```

To build the executable file:
```bash
auto compress
```
